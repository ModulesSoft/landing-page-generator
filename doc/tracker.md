**Owner:** AI Assistant / Dev

**Status:** ✅ 100% | Dates: started 2026-02-20, completed 2026-02-20

**Scope:** new features in engine for nested wrappers and component lifecycle hooks

**Design:** follow plan from earlier session notes (useComponentLifecycle hook, SectionWithLifecycle, dispatcher enhancements) plus wrapper component in `src/components/wrapper/Wrapper.tsx`

**Acceptance criteria:**
- `Wrapper` component implemented and automatically registered
- layout schema updated with `lifetime` property and wrapper props
- `useComponentLifecycle` hook executes beforeMount/onMount/beforeUnmount/onUnmount
- Dispatcher tracks component-specific AbortControllers and aborts them on unmount
- `renderSection` wraps sections with lifecycle when needed
- Unit tests covering each lifecycle phase and abort behavior
- Integration test demonstrating lifecycle actions and wrapper nesting

**Evidence:** tests pass for ActionDispatcher, useComponentLifecycle, Wrapper component, and renderSection normalization.

**Substeps / Detailed tasks:**
1. Define `LifetimeActions` type in `actions.ts` and extend `LayoutSection` in `src/schemas/index.ts`.
2. Add `lifetime` object to `layouts.schema.json` with four optional action references.
3. Implement `Wrapper` component as generic container rendering `sections` recursively.
4. Create `useComponentLifecycle` hook (as designed earlier) handling timing, errors, and abort registration.
5. Extend `ActionDispatcher` with `componentControllers` map, `registerController`, `abortComponent`, and context wiring.
6. Modify `renderSection` to support lifecycle wrapper and normalise actions using new util.
7. Add tests for dispatcher abort logic, hook behavior, wrapper rendering, and schema validation.
8. Manual test: create sample landing using wrapper and lifecycle actions, ensure correct behavior.
9. Review TypeScript and ESLint; update docs accordingly.

- Unit tests verifying that bare arrays dispatch as chains and schema accepts them
- Example JSON using array shorthand works in sample landing

**Evidence:** tests pass for actionUtils and integration with useComponentLifecycle and renderSection.

**Detailed steps:**
1. Create `src/engine/utils/actionUtils.ts` with normalization function.
2. Update TypeScript interfaces accordingly.
3. Patch JSON schemas to `oneOf` action or array-of-action.
4. Modify `renderSection` to call normalizer on `section.actions` and `lifetime` hooks.
